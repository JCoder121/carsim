# Car Simulation for Portola High School Student Dropoff Traffic

worked with Jeffrey Chen @JCoder121

This is a project meant to analyze traffic flow at Portola High School to determine inefficiencies in student dropoff.

The project uses python to map how cars travel through the parking lot where students get dropped off to analyze patterns and reasons for morning traffic congestion.

Result: 
Human nature is hard to overcome and the considerations that were made as a result of this project were not feasible to implement in the rush of morning traffic.
